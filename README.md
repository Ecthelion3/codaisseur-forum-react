# Codaisseur Forum
Originally a [Ruby on Rails application](https://github.com/Ecthelion3/codaisseur-forum) was built by a group of Codaisseur students.
The project consists on a forum application that will be used by current students and alumni from Codaisseur. It will provide the community a better tool for getting questions answered, and making it easier to connect with other people going through the same journey.

This project is a React frontend application to be served by the original Rails app transformed into an api.
